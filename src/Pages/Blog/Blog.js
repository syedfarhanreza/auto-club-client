                    1. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
                </h3>
                <p className='text-justify'>
                    i. <span className='font-semibold'>Local (UI) state</span>: Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.
                    <br />

                    ii. <span className='font-semibold'> Global (UI) state</span>: Global state is data we manage across multiple components.
                    Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.
                    <br />

                    iii.  <span className='font-semibold'>Server state</span> : Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state. Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.
                    <br />
                    iv. <span className='font-semibold'>URL state</span> : Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.
                    URL state is often missing as a category of state, but it is an important one.

                    2. How does prototypical inheritance work?
                </h3>
                <p className='text-justify'>
                    The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

                    3. What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
                </h3>
                <p className='text-justify'>
                    A unit test verifies the behavior of a unit of software in the system. It verifies whether a small and isolated piece of the codebase called “unit” behaves as the developer intended.
                    <br />
                    the purpose of unit tests is to test the smallest possible chunks of functionality in our production code. In most cases what this will mean is writing tests for individual functions that check whether given a specific set of inputs, the test produces the correct output.

                    4. React vs Angular vs Vue.
                </h3>
                <p className='text-justify'>
                    <span className='font-semibold'>Angular</span> is a front-end framework with lots of components, services, and tools. On Angular's site, you can see that they define Angular as: “The modern web developer's platform”. It is developed and maintained by Google developers, but curiously it is not used to implement any of their most common products such as Search or YouTube.
                    <br />
                    <span className='font-semibold'>React</span> is considered a UI library. They define themselves as: “A JavaScript library for building user interfaces”. Facebook developers are behind the development and maintenance of this library. And, in this case, most of Facebook's products are made with React.
                    <br />
                    <span className='font-semibold'>Vue.js</span> is, according to its site: “A progressive JavaScript framework”. Vue.js is developed and led by Evan You, but also it counts on a huge open-source community.
